this is the case in which you have the following inequality
5 {>,>=} 0 => lower(-5)

5 {<,<=} 0 => lower(5)

For the first case you are trying to satisfy 0 > -5 (because -5 is a lower bound). It is already satisfied and this satisfies what we want.

Imagine to have -10 > 0. In this case we want to have 10 as lower bound. So each action affecting the condition develop a coefficient c, which establishes whether the action is doing good or bad wrt that condition. if the action is acting on a variable x, and the condition is actually

x > 0, where x = -10 on the initial state and the action actually increases x by 5 each step, then its contribution is x + m*5 > 0

so m*5 > -10. In this case I have to put a variable in the condition which is positive
